		.: Steps for Creating Users :.
	</h3>


<blockquote>
Following is the same format for creating .ldif files for users. Each user must have his/her own ldif file with the following parameters. 
<br>
Sample Format for user with Roll No. :1 of Computer Department : <tt>1.ldif</tt>
<pre>
<tt>
dn: cn=1,ou=students,ou=comp,dc=coep,dc=com
uid: 1
cn: 1
objectClass: account
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: top
objectClass: shadowAccount
userpassword: test
shadowLastChange: 2000
shadowMax: 99999
shadowWarning: 7
loginShell: /bin/bash
uidNumber: 17000
gidNumber: 14001
homeDirectory: /comp/students/1
gecos: 1,students,comp

</tt>
</pre>

Notes : 
	<ul>
	<li>	'cn' should be the name of the user. We have considered his Roll No. as the name. </li>
	<li> 'ou=students, ou=comp' represents that the user is a 'student' and belongs to 'comp'. The user is added to the 'comp' group which had the gid 14001. This group file was created in the previous step. </li>
	
	<li> 'uid' field is the user id. </li>
	<li> 'homedirectory' is the path of the home directory of the user on the server.</li>
	<li> The file needs to be added to the LDAP server using : <tt> ldapadd -f 1.ldif -x -D "cn=Manager, dc=coep,dc=com" -w secret</tt>

	</ul>

This sample file is available in the LDAP/Scripts directory of our tool. Creating ldif files for number of users is again a tedious task. We have tried to cut down this time, by providing a shell script for the same. It can fed with the range of roll numbers of the students in a department and it automatically creates ldif files and adds them to the server.

It is advised that you read the comments in the <tt>LDAP/Scripts/UserAdd.sh</tt> before proceeding with creation of user accounts.
